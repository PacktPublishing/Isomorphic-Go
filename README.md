# Isomorphic Go
This is the code repository for [Isomorphic Go](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/isomorphic-go?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_content=9781788394185), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.

## About the book
Isomorphic Go is the methodology to create isomorphic web applications using the Go programming language. Isomorphic web applications have the capability to reuse code across environments, increasing the synergy between the web server and the web browser. This book is a hands-on guide that will show you how to build and deploy an Isomorphic Go web application.

Isomorphic Go begins with an in-depth exploration of the benefits provided by the isomorphic web application architecture. You'll be introduced to the Isomorphic Go toolchain, and how it can help you write Go code that functions across environments. You'll learn how to create Go programs in the web browser using GopherJS and how to render isomorphic templates. Then you'll be introduced to end-to-end application routing, use isomorphic handoff to seamlessly transition state from the web server to the web browser, and compose isomorphic forms that have the ability to reuse form validation logic. You'll be exposed to advanced concepts including the implementation of real-time web application functionality with websockets and the creation of reusable components (cogs) that are rendered using the virtual DOM. Finally, you'll see how to deploy an Isomorphic Go web application to a production environment.

## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter 03.

The code will look like the following:
   
        import (
           "bytes" 
           "encoding/gob"
           "html/template"

           "github.com/EngineerKamesh/igb/igweb/shared/models"

            "honnef.co/go/js/dom"
            "honnef.co/go/js/xhr"
         )
